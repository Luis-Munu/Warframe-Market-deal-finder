Speed could be vastly improved if warframe.market responses didn't
have a size cap or i filtered the search.
However i prefer information over speed, it's better to spend 30 minutes
waiting than losing thousands of plats.

things to do:
Convert dirty modules into something readable.
Improve the punctuation system
Optimize the program in almost every imaginable way.
data structure access must be greatly improved."""
